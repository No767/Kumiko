A Discord Bot Built on Discord.py

# Notes

- I'm very new to programming a discord bot. The code isn't even done yet, and all of the features that I planned for is not there yet

- My time is very limited, so support for the bot might not come until weeks to months later. Development of the bot won't be as much as I hope, since I have a lot of exams and classes to go through. Expect delays when new updates will arrive

# Installing

Currently, as of writing this (8/8/2021), the bot is only available if you install all the dependencies and run the main.py file. Once it is ready for release, it will be available for invite on top.gg
