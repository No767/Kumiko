## Kumiko (久美子)

Kumiko is a multipurpose Discord bot built with freedom and choice in mind. Kumiko allows you to decide on whether you wish to use the services provided. Kumiko includes a opt-in economy system, custom quests, an Genshin wish sim, and many more features. Just like Rin, Kumiko is completely written in Python, and is a direct upstream fork from Rin. Which means that Rin's services are directly integrated within Kumiko 
## Rin (リン)

Rin is a Discord bot written with Pycord and Python, and is focused on fetching data from third-party services with lighting performance in mind. For example, you could look up some memes with the Reddit service, 
or find your favorite anime with the MyAnimeList service. Rin supports a lot of services, such as Twitter, MangaDex, Reddit, YouTube, Hypixel, and many more. Rin is also designed to be fast, and uses [Uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop) under the 
hood, which is 2 times faster than Node.js and reaches the same speeds as many Go programs. On top on that, Rin is powered by the fastest JSON parser in the world, SIMDJSON. For more info, please check out the [Docs](https://docs.rinbot.live/).

**For the future of Rin, please see this [gist](https://gist.github.com/No767/de27c61dc471ac331a45ea7c2bda62c0).**

# Prefix

Kumiko uses the same prefix as Rin, which is `/`.

# Inviting the Bot

Still in early production. Not ready for release yet. Currently Kumiko is under v0, which means it's alpha-level software, and thus should not be used in production. Kumiko is subject to breaking changes within this version. Kumiko will be ready to be invited once it reaches to v1, which is production-ready software.
