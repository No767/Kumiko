## Kumiko (久美子)

Kumiko is a multipurpose fork of [Rin](https://github.com/No767/Rin) built with freedom and choice in mind. Kumiko allows you to decide on whether you wish to use the services provided. Kumiko includes a opt-in economy system, and soon a web dashboard (pinned for v2.0). Just like Rin, Kumiko is completely written in Python, and is a direct upstream fork from Rin. Which means that all of Rin's 15+ services are directly integrated into Kumiko.

## Rin (リン)

Rin is a Discord bot written with Pycord and Python, and is focused on fetching data from third-party services with lighting performance in mind. For example, you could look up some memes with the Reddit service, 
or find your favorite anime with the MyAnimeList service. Rin supports a lot of services, such as Twitter, MangaDex, Reddit, YouTube, DeviantArt, Hypixel, and many more. Rin is also designed to be fast, and uses [Uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop) under the 
hood, which is 2 times faster than Node.js and reaches the same speeds as many Go programs. On top on that, Rin is powered by the fatest JSON parser in the world, SIMDJSON. For more info, please check out the [Docs](https://docs.rinbot.live/).

# Prefix

Kumiko uses the same prefix as Rin, which is `/`.

# Inviting the Bot

Still in early production. Not ready for release yet. Currently Kumiko is under v0, which means it's alpha-level software, and thus should not be used in production. Kumiko is subject to breaking changes within this version. Kumiko will be ready to be invited once it reaches to v1, which is production-ready software.
