## Kumiko (久美子)

Kumiko is a multipurpose Discord bot built with freedom and choice in mind. Kumiko allows you to decide on whether you wish to use the services provided. Kumiko includes a opt-in economy system, custom quests, and many more features. Kumiko also includes integration with AniList, Reddit, Twitter, and others.

## Features

- An **Opt-In** Economy System with jobs system and marketplace (WIP, pinned for v1)
    - Includes a marketplace
    - Custom currency (Lavender Petals)
    - Custom jobs (WIP)
    - Rank system (WIP)
    - Custom quests
- Basic Administration Commands
- Search memes, posts, anime, manga, and others!

And some ones that are planned:
- Complete Web Dashboard + Custom Embeds (WIP, pinned for v2)
- Event Logging (Pinned for v1)
- Annoucement releaser with support from GitHub (Pinned for v2)
- AI Driven GAN Anime Waifu Generator (Not implemented yet)
- Selector Roles (pinned for v2)

## Prefix

Kumiko uses both a prefixed command and slash commands. The currently supported prefixes are `?k ` (note the space), and `/`.

## Inviting the Bot

Currently under beta stages. Not ready for release yet. Currently Kumiko is under v0, which means it's beta-level software as of now, and thus should not be used in production. Kumiko is subject to breaking changes within this version. Kumiko will be ready to be invited once it reaches to v1, which is production-ready software.

> Beta production versions of Kumiko may soon be releasing for public testing... Keep an eye out for that!
