## Features

- Customizable prefix module
- Redirects module (If you have overlapping conversations in your channels, this is for you!)
- Anti-ping with customizable settings and embeds
- Quiet mode
- Support for AniList and other anime-related services

## Prefix

Kumiko uses both a prefixed command and slash commands. The currently supported prefixes are `>` , and `/`.

`>` is the default prefix, but this can be customized to be any custom prefix that you wish to have. For example, if you wanted to, you could set the prefix to be `?` instead. These do not change the global prefix; only on the current server where you have set it up.
