A Discord Bot Built on Discord.py

**Note that i am very new to programming a discord bot, and this is only meant (for now at least) to test out and to learn how to build one. The official code will come later once i figure it all out**

# Installing

Currently, as of writing this (8/8/2021), the bot is only available if you install all the dependencies and run the main.py file. Once it is ready for release, it will be available for invite on top.gg
