## Kumiko (久美子)

Kumiko is a personal multipurpose Discord bot built with freedom and choice in mind. Kumiko provides a wide range of features, including an customizable redirects system, revolutionary quiet mode and anti-ping, and many more features. Integration with AniList, and others are also included.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**:
>
> 1. Kumiko is first and foremost my **own personal bot**. Development can be staggered, and is not taken as seriously as my other projects such as Catherine-Chan.
> 2. I would prefer if you do not run instances of Kumiko in production. Just use the `>invite` command or use the Top.gg invite to have the bot on your server instead. The only reason why builds exist if for others to catch bugs and issues. The code provided is for educational use and for others to provide suggestions and feedback only.

## Features

- Customizable prefix module
- Redirects module (If you have overlapping conversations in your channels, this is for you!)
- Anti-ping with customizable settings and embeds
- Quiet mode
- Support for AniList and other anime-related services

## Prefix

Kumiko uses both a prefixed command and slash commands. The currently supported prefixes are `>` , and `/`.

`>` is the default prefix, but this can be customized to be any custom prefix that you wish to have. For example, if you wanted to, you could set the prefix to be `?` instead. These do not change the global prefix; only on the current server where you have set it up.
