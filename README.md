A Discord Bot Built on Discord.py and EasyBot.py

> :exclamation: My time is very limited, so support for the bot might not come until weeks to months later. Development of the bot won't be as much as I hope, since I have a lot of exams and classes to go through. Releases won't be very often due to this

# Installing

Currently, as of writing this (8/8/2021), the bot is only available if you install all the dependencies and run the main.py file. Once it is ready for release, it will be available for invite on top.gg
