## Kumiko (久美子)

Kumiko is a multipurpose Discord bot built with freedom and choice in mind. Kumiko provides a wide range of features, including an customizable and local economy, logging, and many more features. Integration with AniList, and others are also included. 

## Features

- Customizable prefix module
- Customizable local economy module with jobs, ranks, and more
- Custom logging module (aka EventsLog)
- Basic moderation commands
- Search for memes, posts, anime, manga, and others!

And some ones that are planned:

- Complete Web Dashboard + Custom Embeds (WIP, pinned for v2)
- Annoucement releaser with support from GitHub (Pinned for v2)

To see the full list of planned features, please see the roadmap [here](https://github.com/No767/Kumiko/discussions/266) (#266)
## Prefix

Kumiko uses both a prefixed command and slash commands. The currently supported prefixes are `>` , and `/`.

`>` is the default prefix, but this can be customized to be any custom prefix that you wish to have. For example, if you wanted to, you could set the prefix to be `?` instead. These do not change the global prefix; only on the current server where you have set it up 

## Inviting the Bot

Currently under beta stages. Not ready for release yet. Currently Kumiko is under v0, which means it's beta-level software as of now, and thus should not be used in production. Kumiko is subject to breaking changes within this version. Kumiko will be ready to be invited once it reaches to v1, which is production-ready software.

> Beta production versions of Kumiko may soon be releasing for public testing... Keep an eye out for that!

## Support
