A Discord Bot Built on Discord.py and EasyBot.py

<div align=left>

> :exclamation: My time is very limited, so support for the bot might not come until weeks to months later. Development of the bot won't be as much as I hope, since I have a lot of exams and classes to go through. Releases won't be very often due to this

<div align=left>

# Installing

Currently, as of writing this (8/8/2021), the bot is only available if you install all the dependencies and run the main.py file. Once it is ready for release, it will be available for invite on top.gg. More information on this can be found within the [docs](https://rin-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
# Building

Via [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [pip](https://pypi.org/)
