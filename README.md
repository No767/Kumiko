The Multipurpose Version of [Rin](https://github.com/No767/Rin) - Supports Moderation, Economy, and much much more

<div align=left>


## Kumiko (久美子)

Kumiko is a multipurpose fork of [Rin](https://github.com/No767/Rin), and includes features like an economy system, and more. Currently Kumiko is in heavy development, and is not ready for use. Just like 
Rin, Kumiko is written in Python and uses Pycord as well. Kumiko supports all of the services that Rin has.

## Rin

Rin is a Discord bot written with Pycord and Python, and is focused on fetching data from third-party services with lighting performance in mind. For example, you could look up some memes with the Reddit service, 
or find your favorite anime with the MyAnimeList service. Rin supports a lot of services, such as Twitter, MangaDex, Reddit, YouTube, DeviantArt, Hypixel, and many more. Rin is also designed to be fast, and uses [Uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop) under the 
hood, which is 2 times faster than Node.js and reaches the same speeds as many Go programs. On top on that, Rin is powered by the fatest JSON parser in the world, SIMDJSON. For more info, please check out the [Docs](https://docs.rinbot.live/).

# Features

- An **Opt-In** Economy System with jobs system and marketplace (WIP)
- Complete Web Dashboard + Custom Embeds (WIP)
- AI Driven GAN Anime Waifu Generator (Not implemented yet)
- Genshin Impact Wish Sim (Not implemented yet)
- Reaction Roles (Broken)
- All of the services from upstream Rin

# Prefix

Rin's prefix is `/`. Kumiko also uses the same prefix as Rin (`/`)

# Inviting the Bot

Still in early production. Not ready for release yet

# Support 

If you would like to support me with projects like this, please consider starring this project and other ones! Both Rin and Kumiko take a lot of time to make, so please consider supporting me if you can.

# Installing Dependencies

Getting the environment set up for the bot is a kinda complex process. Rin now uses [Uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop), which is a drop-in replacement for [Asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) and is just as fast as Node.js. If you want to get set up, here are the instructions to do so:
