+# Info
+
+Rin is a Discord bot written with Pycord and Python, and is focused on fetching data from third-party services (for the more technical, this is done by contacting APIs). For example, you could look up some memes with the Reddit service, 
+or find your favorite anime with the MyAnimeList service. Rin supports a lot of services, such as Twitter, MangaDex, Reddit, YouTube, DeviantArt, Hypixel, and many more. Rin is also designed to be fast, and uses Uvloop under the 
+hood, which is 2 times faster than Node.js and reaches the same speeds as many Go programs. For more info, please check out the [Docs](https://docs.rinbot.live/).
