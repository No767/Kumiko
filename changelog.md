# ‚ú® Kumiko v0.4.0 ‚ú®

This update brings a ton of new things, and a complete overhaul from what things used to be in `v0.3.0`. With this update, we have reached over 2000 commits for Kumiko, and merges all commits from upstream Rin v2.2.x. With a stable codebase for the economy system, tons of new features and critical improvements, Kumiko has never been better. In fact, this release of Kumiko fixes almost everything that `v0.3.0` had wrong. For details for upstream changes from Rin, please refer to the links below (latest point release):
