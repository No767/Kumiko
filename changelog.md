# ‚ú® Kumiko v0.11.0 ‚ú®

The final feature release before bugfixing and staging tests begin. This release includes changes such as the introduction of the auction house, pronouns module, and others. These features are considered to be stable but will contain bugs and issues. Please report any bugs you find to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/No767/Kumiko/issues) if you find one.

For the full list of changes, please see them here: [`v0.10.2...v0.11.0`](https://github.com/No767/Kumiko/compare/v0.10.2...v0.11.0)

> As a side note, I (Noelle) will not be working on Kumiko as actively as before due to college and work so releases will not be as frequent as before.
