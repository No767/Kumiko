# Remarks
This is the first official release of Rin. Rin is no longer until beta status, and the code has been stable for quite some time now. Rin can be invited to your server [here](https://top.gg/bot/865883525932253184/invite). There might be still bugs to fix, or features to add, so please let me know if you want to add a new feature by submitting a feature request form on the issue tracker. And as always, feel free to contribute to Rin! (Make sure you read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/No767/Rin/blob/master/Community/contributing.md) before contributing!)
