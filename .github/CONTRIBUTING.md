# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! Your effort really does make the project better.
You will need to read the setup instructions before you start working.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the repository. These are not hard rules.

## I'm confused and want to ask questions

Generally, there are much better resources that are available. These include:

- The official support server: [https://discord.gg/ns3e74frqn]
- FAQ in the documentation

Make sure to not ask questions in the issue tracker.

## Ways You Can Contribute

The ways you can contribute are not only limited to code changes, but so much more.
Some of the ways you can contribute are:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state and future of the project
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Improving or editing documentation

Note that if you plan on proposing new features, please first discuss them with the owner and others on the issues page.

## Writing Good Bug Reports

Please be aware of the following when you submit a bug report:

1. Ask on the server first (this is preferred). If you are unsure about an issue, please contact the owner for clarification.
2. Don't open duplicate issues. Please search your issue to see if it has been asked already. Duplicate issues will be closed.
3. When filing a bug about exceptions or stacktrace, please include the complete stacktrace. Without the complete stacktrace the issue might be unsolvable and you will be asked to provide more information.

If a bug report is not clear enough, or missing these information, then more than likely
it'll take longer to fix the bug, or it'll be closed. More than likely clarification will
be asked in order to aid in this process.

## Submitting a Pull Request

This process is fairly straight forward, but make sure to focus your pull request on a single aspect doesn't manage to have scope creep and it's probably good to go.
Ideally the style needs to be consistent but this is fine if it is not met. This project follows PEP-8 guidelines, with an column limit of 88.

## Git Commit Guidelines

1. Use present tense and imperative mood when writing commit messages. For example, `Add new feature` instead of `Added new feature`.
2. Reference issues or pull requests outside of the first line.
    a. Please use the shorthand ``#123`` and not the full URL.

If these guidelines are not met, chances are they will be fixed during the review process.
