====================
Prefix Configuration
====================

Kumiko supports custom guild prefixes. The max amount of prefixes that one guild can have is 10. For example, one guild can have the following prefixes of ``>``, ``>k``, and ``?`` in your guild. 
All three would be considered valid prefixes. Note that application commands (aka slash commands) are also there for the user as well, and are not counted towards the custom prefixes. 

By default, the prefix is ``>``. The prefix will be used only in DMs and in the context of a guild, then the prefix modules will work. 
You can delete, add, view, and update any of the prefixes that you have set for that guild.
