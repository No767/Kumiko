Redirects
---------

If you ever had issues with friends chatting over another conversation, then you would know the exact frustration of that experience.
The redirects system aims to prevent that from happening by literally "redirecting" your conversation into a thread, which then can
be closed to finish the original conversation.

In order to redirect the message, reply to the message you want to redirect, and then use the ``>redirect`` command to send it into a separate thread for further discussion.
The user that you replied to will automatically get added to the thread, and others can join as well if needed. Once done, use the ``>completed`` command to close your 
conversation and hop back into your main channel.
