EventsLog Configuration
=======================

EventsLog is Kumiko's custom logging module. When configured, Kumiko will log events such as puser joins/leaves, bans, and events in regards to some of the features such as eco events, pin events, etc. Later in the future Kumiko will also have support for custom events

Configuration
-------------

Configuration is done by commands, but as of now, there are no commands to edit the default events.
