Privacy Policy
==============
Kumiko is designed to only use what it needs. This means no other data, unless specified, is used or granted to Kumiko, or any other staff and administration members. By using Kumiko, and in turn any of the services provided, you truthfully agree to follow such terms and conditions in exchange for use of Kumiko and their services. Those shall be stated as:

Collections of interest
-----------------------
Kumiko is designed to only take what the bot needs. The data will not be viewed by anyone else unless authorized to do so. The information collected as so is of the following:

- Discord user IDs

Kumiko and her services will only collect the info listed above. Kumiko does not collect IPs, and any other sensitive info unless needed

Reasons for Collecting Info
---------------------------
The info is only used to associate the Discord user with their economy account. The IDs are stored on a database, and are not viewed unless needed.

Data Retention
--------------
All data will be retained for as however long it is needed. If an user decides to create an economy account, the Discord ID of the user is stored, and purged when the user deletes his/her/their account. This applies to the web dashboard and other services as well.

Data Sharing
------------
Kumiko does not share any information with anyone. Kumiko only shares info between her internal services (the web dashboard), and only between the services. All data can only be accessed by the owner of those bots.

Request to Access Such Data
---------------------------
If you feel the need to request for your own data for purposes of security only, please reach out to either the staff, or the owner directly. If you wish to remove such data, please also reach out to either the staff or the owner directly.

Changes to this Policy
----------------------
The staff and the owner reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on the Discord server, and will be reflected on this page.
